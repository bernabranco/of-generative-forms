# of_generative_art
A openframeworks app to explore generative art in 3D space. This is a never ending work which may always be further explored. Would love to see what kind of interesting results you can achieve.

Usage:
- Place "generative_forms_1" in Openframeworks "Apps" folder;
- click the "Import" button in the ProjectGenerator and type ""generative_forms_1";
- Press "Update" button
- Run

Prints!
